# Deep Q Learning TicTacToe

This program implements a PyGame TicTacToe game that can be played by two humans, by a human vs. an algorythmic AI, and a human vs. a Neural Network trained by playing against the algorythmic AI.

While training the visuals of the game can be disabled to make training much faster.

All the training parameters can be configured in the utils/constants.py module.
